## Abstract
With the rapid proliferation of telecommunication and RF applications, so, too, has demand grown for tools to design and characterize these devices. scikit-rf is a Python package designed to make RF/microwave engineering both robust and approachable. The package provides a modern, object-oriented library for RF network analysis, circuit building, calibration, and simulation.
